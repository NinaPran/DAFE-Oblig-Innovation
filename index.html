          <h2> WHO IS SAVE THE CHILDREN?</h2>
          <!-- Referanse Wiki og Save the childrens homepage-->
          <p> Save the children was established in 1919 in the United Kingdom to save children in Germany and
            Austria-Hungary from
            starvation during World War 1. They are now an international organisation in 123
            countries and work for better health, education and protection of children. They advocate for children and
            influence
            governments, international institutions, and the private sector to help realise children’s rights. In times
            of
            crises they deliver life-saving support for children and their families.</p>

            innovation on
            how to solve dropout as a direct consequence of the pandemic. Using the Norwegian Folkehelseinstituttet
            (FHI)
            recommendation about social distancing as one of the best ways to prevent the spread of COVID 19. NOvid will
