          <h2> WHO IS SAVE THE CHILDREN?</h2>
          <p> Save the children was established in 1919 in the United Kingdom to save children in Germany and
            Austria-Hungary from
            starvation during the Allied blockade in the World War 1. They are now an international organisation in 123
            countries and work for better health education and protection of children. They advocate for children and
            influence
            governments, international institutions, and the private sector to help realise children’s rights. In times
            of
            crises they deliver life-saving support for children and their families.

          <p> At the introduction innovation week at the state university of Oslo Metropolitan University (Oslomet),
            Save
            the Children explained to NOvid the problem about children missing out of school, especially now during the
            COVID 19
            pandemic. They presented the issue of how attendance and enrolment data could prevent dropout in school and
            how
            technology could play a role in solving this issue. </p>
