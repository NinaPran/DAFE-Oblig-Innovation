        <h3> Brief </h3>
        <p> At the introduction innovation week at the state university of Oslo Metropolitan University (Oslomet), Save the
          Children explained to NOvid the problem about children missing out of school, especially now during the COVID 19
          pandemic. They presented the issue of how attendance and enrolment data could prevent dropout in school and how
          technology could play a role in solving this issue. </p>

      <p> Based on the Principles for Digital Development and the research questions;
        “How can attendance and enrolment data prevent dropout in school?” and
        “How can technology play a role in solving the issue?” we have decided to focus
        our innovation on how to solve dropout as a direct consequence of the pandemic.
        NOvid will make social distancing effortless.
