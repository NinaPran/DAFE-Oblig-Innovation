<h2>The collaboration</h2>
<p>At the introduction innovation week at the state university of Oslo Metropolitan University (Oslomet), Save the
    Children explained to NOvid the problem about children missing out of school, especially now during the COVID 19
    pandemic. They presented the issue of how attendance and enrolment data could prevent dropout in school and how
    technology could play a role in solving this issue. </p>
<h2>School dropouts</h2>
<p>According to Save the Children, school dropout is a continuous problem all over the world, especially in a country
    like Niger. Because of school shutdown due to COVID 19, many of these children will not return and the problem will
    only get bigger.</p>

<h3>COVID 19 related dropout statistics in Niger according to Africa News</h3>
<p>There are 12,5 million children in Niger

    • 3.8 million children have dropped out of school in total
    • 2,6 million have dropped out of school for other reasons
    • 1,2 million have dropped out due to Corona (COVID 19)</p>

<h2>NOvid</h2>
<p>NOvid was established to solve the issue presented by Save the Children. They decided to focus their innovation on
    how to solve dropout as a direct consequence of the pandemic. Using the Norwegian Folkehelseinstituttet (FHI)
    recommendation about social distancing as one of the best ways to prevent the spread of COVID 19. NOvid will make
